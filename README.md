Python code to get the 99% off code


This Project came to my mind on year 2021 Black Friday as Digikala.com Started a Competition to give away 99% off codes
Rules were simple as follow

1 ) The code is hidden in a picture of a product in about 900 products.

2 ) Each product has about 10 to 15 images so we are facing about 10000 pictures.

3 ) anyone who finds the code first can use it and win.

So i decided to write a code for entertainment ( This code is not optimized !!!!  its just for fun and Learning )
There are two programs code that involve

a) Download_Images_Repository.py  --->  This Program Downloads all 10000 images and save them in local storage we need these images for 2 reason

1 ) if the is written in a image that is edited we can compare 2 images and if any chnage occured to original image we retrive the code

2 ) if the code is in new product image that has been added we can compare the name with the ones we download and if its new we investigate the new image
